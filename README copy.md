Tech Stack
Frontend: React + TypeScript

Deployment: Vercel, Netlify, or Firebase Hosting


Steps:
Store the file in localStorage:

You will save the file as a Blob (binary data) or Base64 string in localStorage.
You will need to use FileReader to convert the file into a Base64 string and store it.
Store the URL in the database:

After storing the file in localStorage, you will generate a URL and save this URL (not the Base64 string) in your database.
You would send this URL to the server and store it along with other task data.
Retrieve the file from localStorage:

You will use the saved URL in localStorage to retrieve and display the file when needed.
Let's modify your code step by step to achieve this.
